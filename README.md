# My Portfolio Page

In this project I created my own portfolio page from scratch. The purposes of this project was to highlight the use of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The portfolio contains deployed web applications of my previous project 'Horiseon Task' along with well known websites to take up space that will later be replaced with my own future projects. 

## Criteria that I met to achieve this

* When the page is loaded my name, a recent photo and a navigation bar is visible.
* Clicking the links in the navigation bar causes the UI to scroll to the corresponding section.
* The 'My Work' section contains titled images of my applications.
* The first application is larger in size than the other images.
* When an image of my application is clicked it takes you to that deployed application.
* The page has a responsive layout that adapts to your viewpoint.
